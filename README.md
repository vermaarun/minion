# MINION - Happy To Help :)

**What problem is the bot trying to solve?** <br>
Minion is designed to help employees in their day-to-day HR related activities like
* Applying for leave
* Raising a ticket
* Searching for other employees

**Inspiration for choosing this bot** <br>
The current method of performing the different HR activities involve quite a bit of navigation through internal web pages and a lot of point and click. We wanted to simplify the whole process by allowing the users to simply chat and get their work done by Minion.

**Platforms used for building the bot.** <br>
* Python Chatterbot
* Django

**Tech stacks used.(Access to the 3rd party associations)** <br>
The various tech stack used for the chat bot are:
* Backend
    * Python 3.5
    * Django 2.0
* Frontend
    * HTML5/CSS/JS
    * Bootstrap 4
